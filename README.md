# ***Hi there I'm Fayyaz H. Sahito ðŸ‘‹âš¡***
***I'm a Junior DevOps and Cloud Engineer from Pakistan. I'm currently working on DevOps tools like Kubernetes, Ansible, Docker, and Teraform, and my research papers as well. I'm pretty much interested in both AWS and Azure Cloud platforms. In networking my area of interest is Security. When I'm not developing and building things, I spend my time learning online, writing an article, and watching documentaries, Most of my days are spent working on projects, studying or watching new trends of technologies.***
